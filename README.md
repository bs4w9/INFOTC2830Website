# INFOTC2830Website
An example resume site we made in INFOTC 2830

This site is the project we made in INFOTC 2830. The class focused on teaching the basics of programming so each page was a different assignment. Some of the requirements in class wanted us to do the assignment from scratch so we could learn the basics. For most assignments we were not allowed to use frameworks such as Booststrap so some pages aren't exactly how you would design it in the industry.
